# MemoryMatchingGame

This is a small card matching game that was created using the Processing library to build the Graphical User Interface. 
The game is one player only and in the game there are  12 cards are initially laid face down on a surface.
Each turn, the player selects two faced down cards, which are then flipped over. If the two cards match, they remain faced up. 
Otherwise, they are both flipped back to face down. When the player successfully turns all the cards up, the program will declare him a Winner of the game!
